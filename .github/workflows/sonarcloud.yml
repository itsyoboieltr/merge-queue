# This GitHub action will checkout and scan third party code.
# Please ensure that any changes to this action do not perform
# actions that may result in code from that branch being executed
# such as installing dependencies or running build scripts.

# Updating this file on feature branches or forks will not reflect changes.
# For security reasons, always the latest version from the default branch is used.
# This means any changes made to this file in a feature branch will not be considered until they are merged.
